### Blank server setup guide
##### Tested on the 2018/03 AMI release.
###### The purpose is to have all infos and commands in a single place, preventing errors and time losses.

I will report here a sequence of mainly not explained commands, these commands are gathered from [this AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html), [this node guide](https://www.e2enetworks.com/help/knowledge-base/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-on-centos/), and [this Certbot guide](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/centos6-apache). Head there if needed to understand what the commands actually do.
